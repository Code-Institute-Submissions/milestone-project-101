# Memory Game | A simple single-player pattern-matching memory game.

Code Institute Milestone Project 2 - Interactive Frontend Development

This project is a simple single-player pattern matching game inpisred by Simon and Bop It. It contains 4 squares, that light up in a randomly generated sequence and the user has to replicate that sequence successfully to pass the level and gain score. The demonstration sequence lights up faster and faster each level to give the user a bit of a challenge, as well as recording the users highscore. There is no level-cap or score-cap, the only limit is the users ability to remember the sequence and get it right. Why not try it yourself, what's the highest score you can get?

## UX
Use this section to provide insight into your UX process, focusing on who this website is for, what it is that they want to achieve and how your project is the best way to help them achieve these things.

### User Stories
In particular, as part of this section we recommend that you provide a list of User Stories, with the following general structure:

### Wireframes
As a user type, I want to perform an action, so that I can achieve a goal.
This section is also where you would share links to any wireframes, mockups, diagrams etc. that you created as part of the design process. These files should themselves either be included as a pdf file in the project itself (in an separate directory), or just hosted elsewhere online and can be in any format that is viewable inside the browser.

---

## Features
In this section, you should go over the different parts of your project, and describe each in a sentence or so.

### Existing Features
Feature 1 - allows users X to achieve Y, by having them fill out Z
...
For some/all of your features, you may choose to reference the specific project files that implement them, although this is entirely optional.

### Features Left to Implement
In addition, you may also use this section to discuss plans for additional features to be implemented in the future:

## Technologies Used
In this section, you should mention all of the languages, frameworks, libraries, and any other tools that you have used to construct this project. For each, provide its name, a link to its official site and a short sentence of why it was used.

The following technologies has been used in this project:

### Languages
- [HTML](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTML): for the structure of my project
- [CSS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cascading_Style_Sheets): for most of the styling in my project
- [JavaScript](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JavaScript): for the entire game logic, user feedback, score and level increase

### Styling
- [Google fonts](https://fonts.google.com/): for the fonts I used; 'Inconsolata', 'Dosis' and 'Oxygen'
- [Coolors](https://coolors.co/gradients): for the background gradients in the squares, the square area and the footer

### Frameworks/ libraries
- [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/) for the grid layout, keep everhything neat and tidy
- [jQuery](https://code.jquery.com/)for the logic of the game

### Additional
- [CSS Validator](https://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/validator.html.en) I used this to validate the CSS code
- [Markup Validator](https://validator.w3.org/) I used this to validate the HTML code
- [HTML Formatter](https://htmlformatter.com/) I used this to format my HTML
- [Chrome DevTools](https://developers.google.com/web/tools/chrome-devtools) I used the console in the browser to debug my game as well as to test the responsiveness of the elements as I built my project.

## Testing
In this section, you need to convince the assessor that you have conducted enough testing to legitimately believe that the site works well. Essentially, in this part you will want to go over all of your user stories from the UX section and ensure that they all work as intended, with the project providing an easy and straightforward way for the users to achieve their goals.

Whenever it is feasible, prefer to automate your tests, and if you've done so, provide a brief explanation of your approach, link to the test file(s) and explain how to run them.

For any scenarios that have not been automated, test the user stories manually and provide as much detail as is relevant. A particularly useful form for describing your testing process is via scenarios, such as:

Contact form:
Go to the "Contact Us" page
Try to submit the empty form and verify that an error message about the required fields appears
Try to submit the form with an invalid email address and verify that a relevant error message appears
Try to submit the form with all inputs valid and verify that a success message appears.
In addition, you should mention in this section how your project looks and works on different browsers and screen sizes.

You should also mention in this section any interesting bugs or problems you discovered during your testing, even if you haven't addressed them yet.

If this section grows too long, you may want to split it off into a separate file and link to it from here.

## Deployment
### GitHub Pages

To deploy the website on github pages, the following steps need to be taken:

1. Open GitHub and go to your **'Repository'**

4. Under GitHub pages, click on the dropdown button under **'Source'** and select the **'Master Branch'** option
5. A green box should appear with the following message **'Your site is published at.../'**
6. After selecting this, you need to choose a **'Theme'**, this asigns a **'Jekyll'** file to your project and makes your website accessable.


### GitPod - running code locally

To deploy the code locally using gitpod, the follow steps need to be taken:

1. Open GitPod, go to the **Workspace** your project is located in
2. Once laoded, go the **Console/ Terminal** located in the bottom 3rd of the screen
3. Input **'python3 -m http.server'** then press return
4. A dialouge box reading 'A service is available on port 8000' will show to the right. Click on 'Open Browser'
